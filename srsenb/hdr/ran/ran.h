/* IMPORTANT NOTES ON DEFULT SLICE:
 * The Default slice is that resource slice which allows UE to complete their
 * connection with the Network. Without such mechanism, no Downlink resources
 * will ever be assigned to any UE, and no connection will ever take place.
 * 
 * The default slice belongs to no tenant, but all UE will initially be part of
 * it.
 * 
 * Slice ID formatting is as follows:   |----| PLMN  |T| -----|
 * (T stands for Tag)                   |    |       | |      |
 *                                      |    |       | |      | */
